During the (October - ~May) winter months we organize indoor jams.

During the summer the jam moves to the Wilhelminapark. When the weather permits, you can usually join a group of acrobats during the afternoon. Exact times vary depending on when people show up.

Location close to park Lepelenburg, and parking is free in the area around the venue.

Entry is €5 per person. If you are doing a course with Op de Kop you can join for free. Paying can be done in cash, or (preferably) through a payment request.

There are mats available, and the ceiling is high enough to do standing tricks.
