***Highly advanced***

For the advanced level, you register with a fixed partner. With your partner, we expect you to be working on skills like hand-to-hand or other tricks at a comparable level.

In these lessons, you will work with your own partner on your own tricks. We provide sufficient guidance and inspiration to help you learn the tricks at a higher level!

If you are unsure about your level or do not currently have a partner, please contact info@op-de-kop.nl.
