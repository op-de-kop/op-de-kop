## Acro Bootcamp

Do you want to become a stronger acrobat? Join our new Acro Bootcamp on Mondays! This training is focused on building strength specifically for acrobats. The exercises are tailored to the needs of acrobats, and sometimes we use each other's bodies as weights to challenge the muscles even more!

We are currently looking for acrobats interested in attending this bootcamp. The first series will run from September through December.

<strong>Timeslot not yet definitive:</strong> Monday 18:30 - 19:30 <em>or</em> 21:00 - 22:00

Let us know if you are interested!

***Highly advanced***

For the advanced level, you register with a fixed partner. With your partner, we expect you to be working on skills like hand-to-hand or other tricks at a comparable level.

In these lessons, you will work with your own partner on your own tricks. We provide sufficient guidance and inspiration to help you learn the tricks at a higher level!

If you are unsure about your level or do not currently have a partner, please contact info@op-de-kop.nl.
